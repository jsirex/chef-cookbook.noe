#
# This file provides a full specification for maintaining your chef cookbook using Noe.
# It consists of two main sections: template-info and variables. The first one contains
# meta-information about the skeleton itself while the second one provides information
# about your chef cookbook.
#
# Please update the first part with care, as it immediately affects the way Noe will
# manage the files of your own project. The second part may be updated more freely.
#
# Remember that your project may use a shorter version of this file as it will be
# automatically completed with default options when invoking 'noe go'. In particular,
# the first section (under template-info) is only required to contain the name and
# version of the template to use.
#
# Use 'noe prepare --template=!{template_name} --layout=short' to generate a shorter
# version of this file.
#
# See 'noe help prepare' and 'noe help show-spec' for more information.
#
template-info:

  # Don't remove the name and version entries, which are ALWAYS required
  name: "!{template_name}"
  version: 1.5.1

  # The following entries are information about the template itself and can safely
  # be removed on your own project.

  #
  # Below starts the template manifest.
  #
  # Each entry is related to a template file and may contain the following keys:
  #   - description: short explanation of the role the file plays in your project
  #   - safe-override: may the file be safely overrided by 'noe go --safe-override'?
  #   - wlang-dialect: what dialect must be used for wlang instantiation. When no
  #     dialect is specified, the dialect under main-wlang-dialect is used.
  #
  # You can safely remove the whole manifest or entries for which the default values
  # are ok for your project. Otherwise, values defined below override the default ones
  # provided by the template.
  #
  # An typical example for keeping an entry here is to set safe-override to false for
  # specific project files you want to manage manually.
